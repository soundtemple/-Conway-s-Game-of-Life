#Marketplacer Coding Challenge
This is a solution to the Marketplacer Coding Challenge.  It implements a a version of Conwayâ€™s game of Life, using Javascript.

## Methodology
1. Understand the rules of the game.
2. Document required functionality
3. Create solution in console
4. Create grid & implement solution in browser window

## Tech
jQuery and Underscore.js were used to assist with grid creation.

## Usage
Open index.html
use game control buttons to start and stop generation


## Possible Improvements
* Using jQuery to create and update the grid. Might have been achieved more efficiently using React.  
* Cell state function calculations could use improved readability
* Accounting for neighbours outside the array index range required usage of an additional variable and might have been accounted for in a better way.

#### Thanks for inviting me to participate.  I enjoyed the challenge
